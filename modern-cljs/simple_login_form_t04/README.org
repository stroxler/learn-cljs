* Notes on this tutorial

** I didn't quite follow the example

I made =login.cljs= be imported by core.cljs, rather than
using =login.cljs= only and then needing to tweak the
=main.cljs.edn= file, which is what the actual tutorial
wants. If I had done the latter, then I would have had to
modify the =:require= block in the =.edn= file to also
require =modern-cljs.login=... it seems that you need to
list any namespaces that actually execute top-level code
in this block. I prefer the pattern where only =core=
executes top-level code.

** the example isn't very complete

This tutorial ends with a working validation function, but
there's not actual server-side endpoint. We will deal with
this in a later tutorial.
