* Notes on this tutorial

This is a first, maximally simple example of an app that
actually "does" something: a simple form validator, implemented
using raw DOM functions.

In Tutorials 5 and 6 we'll see how to use the domina library to
use clojurescript in more of a jquery-style for multi-page
webapps where the pages are either static or are templated
server-side
