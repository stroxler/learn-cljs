* Notes on this tutorial

Here we introduce the =domina= library, which is a
=jquery=-like clojurescript library for simple DOM
manipulation. Using it, we make a simple calculator
form.

We also refactor the project structure a bit to
work for a multi-page app, with both the login and
the price calculator.
